# README
Goal:

To become familiar with the basics of Ruby on Rails

Assignment:

Build a basic blogging app in Rails.

There should be a User, Post, and Comment model.

Work on this project while following the same process as with the micro-blogging app:

Draw your ERD
Plan out each route
Plan out how each view will look for each model.
Create a repo, push to GitHub
Start coding!

User model: CRUD + sign up, login, logout
Post: CRUD
Comment: C, R & D (don't have to do update)
A user can create posts.
A user can leave a comment on a post.
Code is well commented and contains a README
......

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
